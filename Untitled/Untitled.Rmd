# Comprehensive Exam
.left-column[

]

.right-column[
- Normally taken within 12 to 24 months after entry into the PhD degree program.

- The Comprehensive Exam is held once a year in June. 
- Two part exam:
  1. Epidemiologic and Biostatistical methods (based on 2 published papers)
  2. Study design

- Pass/Fail: Students must pass *both* with 65%. A "Fail" on either (or both) must repeat the exam the following year.
]

# Thesis Protocol
.left-column[
```{r, echo=F, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
ggplot() + geom_fontawesome("fa-rocket", color='steelblue') + theme_void()
```
]
.right-column[
- Propose and defend a comprehensive research project and to convince their peers of its scientific merit and originality.

- Provide sufficient background and detail on data sources; research design, statistical analyses, and power/precision/sample size (as applicable) for each of the research objectives; and study limitations.

- Reviewed by 2 faculty and an external reviewer.

- May require substantial revisions or resubmission.

# Doctoral Thesis
.left-column[
```{r, echo=F, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}

- "Officially" after passing the comprehensive exam and defending the thesis protocol. 

- Must constitute original scholarship and must be a distinct contribution to knowledge.

- Thesis committee should reflect the intellectual requirements needed to support your work.  
  - Minimum of 1 additional member (often a Biostatistician)
  - More usually better, especially for substantive, clinical, or methodological expertise and support.
