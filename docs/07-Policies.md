## Fast-Track from MSc to PhD

The transfer policy applies ONLY to students in Epidemiology and Biostatistics programs. A student who has been accepted into the M.Sc. program can request transfer into the Ph.D. program. The formal transfer into the Ph.D. program should occur within 12 months of initial enrollment in the Master's program.

In order to transfer from the M.Sc. to the Ph.D. program, the M.Sc. student must complete all required courses for the M.Sc. program with a minimum GPA of 3.7.

## Policy on Departmental Seminars

Updated November 9th, 2015
The Department considers attendance at its seminars an important component of training and expects all students to attend as frequently as possible.

All Epidemiology and Public Health graduate students will be expected to attend 60% of the Epidemiology Seminars each term irrespective of their program year. Attendance at seminars will be mandatory to maintain “good standing” during academic studies. This means that attendance at seminars will be required to maintain eligibility for Departmental support for prizes, financial aid, travel awards, studentship applications, etc. Attendance at Biostatistics or at other seminars on campus or in teaching hospitals will be encouraged as always depending on one's areas of interest but will not be mandatory.

Students who will be unable to attend 60% of the seminars should send a request for an exemption to the chairs office justifying their absence (eg. residing outside of Montreal, travel relating to their studies, family reasons).

## Policy on Email

University Policy Concerning E-Mail As An Official Means Of Communication With Students. E-mail is an official means of communication between McGill University and its students.
 

In order to satisfy the need for timely and efficient communication, and to provide a better service to its students, McGill University has instituted a policy that establishes e-mail as an official means of communicating with students.

Upon registration at McGill, each student is assigned an official McGill e-mail address and a McGill e-mail box. This address may be viewed and verified via Minerva, under the Personal menu.

The McGill E-mail Address points to the McGill e-mail box by default for all students. As with all official University communications, it is the student's responsibility to ensure that time-critical e-mail is accessed, read, and acted upon in a timely fashion. If a student chooses to forward University e-mail to another e-mail mailbox, it is that student's responsibility to ensure that the alternate account is viable.

This policy applies to all McGill students and employees who manage official communications with students.

For confidential and official communication requiring an original signature, communication is by (physical) mail. Therefore, please ensure that your current postal address is updated on Minerva.  Students must also inform the Student Affairs Office and complete the details in Minerva.

**Please keep in mind that although we do our best to keep all the information on the website up to date, we may have missed something. If you ever have questions about anything please contact the Student Affairs Office to clarify.
