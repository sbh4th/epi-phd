# Funding

## Deparmental Obligations
The Department, jointly with the PhD student's supervisor, offers an annual funding package valued at a *minimum* of $25,000 for a *maximum* of four years. For international PhD students, the Department will use different mechanisms such as Deferential Fee Waivers, to cover the International Differential tuition so that they pay tuition at the same level as Canadian students.

Financial support is conditional upon academic performance, as well as **student efforts to apply for all external/internal graduate fellowship funding for which they are eligible**, including CIHR, FRQS, SSHRC, NSERC, etc., as well as the McGill Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences and Hospital Research Institute competitions.
