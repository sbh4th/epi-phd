<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Concentration Coursework</h2>
<p>As described previously, there are presently 3 options for PhD students that wish to pursue concentrated work in substantive areas related to either Global Health, Pharmacoepidemiology, or Population Dynamics. These options all require additional courses to be completed <em>in addition to</em> the required courses for all Epidemiology PhD students.</p>
<div id="global-health-option" class="section level3" number="3.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Global Health Option</h3>
<p>This option will provide enhanced training in global health to graduate students registered in the Ph.D. in Epidemiology; Global Health degree program at McGill. Students will become familiar with topics of global health relevance and incorporate this into their core coursework and thesis research. The thesis must be relevant to global health and approved by the Global Health Coordinating Committee. Contextualizing the core training students receive in epidemiology and in their respective substantive discipline within the global health research domain will enhance their academic experience. Graduates of this option will be prepared to pursue further training in global health or to undertake a variety of career opportunities in global health in Canada or internationally.</p>
<p>Program Requirements</p>
<p>Thesis</p>
<p>A thesis for the doctoral degree must constitute original scholarship and must be a distinct contribution to knowledge. It must show familiarity with previous work in the field and must demonstrate ability to plan and carry out research, organize results, and defend the approach and conclusions in a scholarly manner. The research presented must meet current standards of the discipline; as well, the thesis must clearly demonstrate how the research advances knowledge in the field. Finally, the thesis must be written in compliance with norms for academic and scholarly expression and for publication in the public domain. The thesis must be relevant to global health and approved by the Global Health Coordinating Committee.</p>

Comprehensive Exam (EPIB 701)</p>
<p>Students will normally take the Comprehensive Exam (EPIB 701) within 12 to 24 months of entry into the Ph.D. degree program. The Comprehensive Exam is held once a year in June. The exam is intended to test students’ ability to synthesize and integrate epidemiological knowledge. For details on the Comprehensive Exam, see the course outline for EPIB 701. The exam is graded “Pass” or “Fail.” Students with a “Fail” must repeat the exam the following year.</p>
<p>Protocol Defense (EPIB 702)</p>
<p>The comprehensive exam and the above required courses are usually completed before submitting and defending the thesis research protocol in EPIB 702. For details on the Protocol Defense, see the course outline for EPIB 702. The exam is graded “Pass” or “Provisional Pass” or “Fail.”</p>
<p>Students with a “Provisional Pass” (some deficiencies noted but not enough to stop progress on the thesis) are recommended to undertake (in consultation with their supervisor), specific remedial steps to address the areas of weakness identified in the exam. These could include additional courses, essays, assignments, and short courses. After satisfactory completion of these remedial steps the student will be considered to have a “Pass” on the Comprehensive Exam/Protocol Defense. Students are permitted to continue with their normal progression through the program.</p>
<p>Students with a “Fail” must repeat the exam the following year.</p>
<p>Thesis Research</p>
<p>Thesis research is normally actively undertaken following the comprehensive Exam. It is expected that students will complete their degree within 48 to 60 months of entry into the Ph.D. degree program.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Pharmacoepidemiology Additional Reqired Courses</h3>
<p>This program provides in-depth training for graduate students on pharmacoepidemiologic methods and the application of these methods to study the population effects (benefits and harm) of pharmaceutical products. Students will acquire the skills to become independent investigators and conduct original research in pharmacoepidemiology. Career opportunities for graduates are multiple and include work in industry, government, or academia. Students will be required to participate in the Pharmacoepidemiology Journal Club. Research topics must be related to pharmacoepidemiology and approved by the program coordinating committee.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> Population Dynamics Additional Required Courses</h3>
<p>The Population Dynamics Option (PDO) is a cross-disciplinary, cross-faculty graduate program offered by the Centre on Population Dynamics (CPD) as an option within existing master’s and doctoral programs in the Departments of Sociology, Economics, and Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health (EBOH) at McGill University. Students who have been admitted through their home department or faculty may apply for admission to the option. The option is coordinated by the CPD, in partnership with participating academic units.</p>
<p>Thus, in addition to the rigorous training provided in the Department of EBOH, graduate students who choose this option become Centre on Population Dynamics (CPD) student trainees. This affiliation notably offers opportunities for interdisciplinary research and supervision. The option also provides a forum whereby graduate students bring their disciplinary perspectives together and enrich each other’s learning through structured courses, a weekly seminar series, and informal discussions and networking.</p>
<p>With interdisciplinary research being increasingly important to understanding complex social and biological processes, CPD student trainees benefit from both a strong disciplinary foundation from their departmental affiliations, as well as from the sharing of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries through CPD activities.</p>
