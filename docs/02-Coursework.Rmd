# Admissions

The uApply application system will open September 15, 2020 for the Fall 2021 admission cycle. Please see www.mcgill.ca/gradapplicants/apply for detailed instructions on how to use the system and how to upload required supporting documents.

Applicants to the non-thesis programs must specify their choice of concentration when applying and discuss their interest in their personal statement.

Any applications that are incomplete (including letters of reference, scores from any required standardized tests and grades) by the application deadline will not be considered.

Please note that the Department only admits new students in the Fall term. Applications for the Winter or Summer terms are not accepted. It is important that you select the correct term when completing the application form. We will not be able to change the application term or refund your application fee if you enter the wrong term.
