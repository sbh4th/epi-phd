Epidemiology is the study and analysis of the patterns and causes of disease in human populations. It forms the core discipline of public health by identifying the distribution and determinants of health and disease, and by gaining the etiologic understanding to intervene toward the improvement of population health. The PhD program in epidemiology at McGill trains scientists and health professionals to design and conduct studies, analyze health data and effectively communicate scientific results, and to gain novel insights into the causes and prevention of diseases at the population level. Epidemiologic work at the doctoral level involves a thorough integration of biological knowledge of pathogenesis, statistical knowledge of quantitative analysis and causal inference, and sociological knowledge to place these insights in the context of dynamic and interconnected human populations. Major areas of strength at McGill include epidemiologic methods, clinical epidemiology, infectious diseases, social epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology, public and population health, global health, environmental epidemiology, chronic diseases and aging, and perinatal epidemiology. 1.1 Competencies Our program aims to prepare our students for successful careers in epidemiology. Upon successful completion of the PhD in Epidemiology at McGill, we aim for our students to: Understand the difference between descriptive and etiologic epidemiologic studies, and the value of both designs for public health science; Develop a thorough understanding of modern epidemiologic methods and how they are utilized in the service of descriptive, predictive, and etiologic study designs; Apply quantitative skills to the analysis of epidemiologic data using statistical software; Systematically and critically review the epidemiologic literature, synthesize existing evidence, and identify important gaps in knowledge; Design, write, and critique an independent research proposal for answering epidemiologic questions; 1.2 High-Level Program Overview Successful completion of the PhD program in EBOH involves 4 key milestones: - Required coursework; - Passing a comprehensive exam; - Developing and defending a thesis protocol; and - Writing and defending the doctoral thesis. The timeline for program completion varies depending on each student’s circumstances and subject matter, but most of our students complete the PhD in around 5 years.

Students register for EPIB 702 in both Fall and Winter terms of their second year. 2.2 Elective courses Students are also required to take 9 credits of elective coursework, at the 500 level or higher, with a minimum of 3 credits in Biostatistics and 6 credits in an epidemiologic and/or substantive topic (normally related to the thesis topic). Elective courses must be chosen in consultation with the student’s supervisor and/or the degree program’s director or adviser. These courses can be chosen from the Department’s current offer of more than 40 courses in EBOH as well as from other McGill Departments. To assist you in your course selections see the Ph.D. Epidemiology Electives Guidelines page. Below in Table 2.1 you can find a list of current EBOH courses commonly taken as electives. However, courses from other departments or faculties may be possible, depending on the thesis subject matter and subject to the approval of your supervisor(s) and the Program Director.

They are NOT substitutes for existing courses but are, rather, ways for students in the programs to enrich their education in an organized way on topics not otherwise covered or not covered sufficiently (in depth or breadth) in existing courses. Students enrolled in the department may take Directed Reading courses for credit towards a degree under the rubric of the Special Topics offerings. These courses may be for 1, 2, or 3 credits. Directed Reading courses should conform to the usual semester format unless the specific circumstances of the course require flexibility. However, students are expected to complete such a course within no more than any six month period. Students will be expected to submit for approval in advance material that provides the objectives and methods to be used for the directed reading work. There is considerable flexibility in what constitutes a directed reading course, but certain requirements must be met before work can begin, including: Students must themselves propose a supervising faculty member with whom to work. With the faculty supervisor, students must prepare an adequate project proposal commensurate with the number of credits sought that includes: The rationale for doing this work as a Directed Reading course and for the number of credits sought. As well, this statement should indicate how it relates to, but is separate from, thesis work when the student is in a thesis program. An outline of the work to be done and the final product/output to be submitted. If a Reading Course is being proposed, a preliminary bibliography and a planned reading schedule should be included. A timetable, with appropriate milestones to assess a student’s progress and the measures to be used to evaluate the work (e.g., number of written assignments and their length). A student’s faculty supervisor will be responsible for this evaluation as is the case for “regular” courses. A timetable indicating when the student and faculty supervisor will meet. The project proposal, signed by both the student and the supervisor, should be submitted to the Student Affairs Office a minimum of one month prior to the start of the semester in which the course will take place. The director, along with one other person on the Program Committee who has accepted responsibility for curriculum matters, will review the proposal and determine if it is to be approved. Once approved internally, a copy will be sent to the Director of Graduate Studies as well as to the Department’s Graduate Studies Office, with a request that the latter obtain a Special Topics course number for the offering. A copy of the final approved version of the course content will be placed in the student’s file. 2.4 Example curriculum The timing and choices to fulfill the course requirements will likely be unique for each student. Below we provide one example of a possible curriculum over the course of the program.

In addition to the other milestones for the PhD degree (Comprehensive Exam, Protocol Defence, Thesis Defence), these options all require additional courses to be completed in addition to the required courses for all Epidemiology PhD students. 3.1 Global Health Option This option will provide enhanced training in global health to graduate students registered in the PhD in Epidemiology; Global Health degree program at McGill. Students will become familiar with topics of global health relevance and incorporate this into their core coursework and thesis research. The thesis must be relevant to global health and approved by the Global Health Coordinating Committee. Contextualizing the core training students receive in epidemiology and in their respective substantive discipline within the global health research domain will enhance their academic experience. Graduates of this option will be prepared to pursue further training in global health or to undertake a variety of career opportunities in global health in Canada or internationally. The PhD thesis must be relevant to global health and approved by the Global Health Coordinating Committee.

Students will acquire the skills to become independent investigators and conduct original research in pharmacoepidemiology. Career opportunities for graduates are multiple and include work in industry, government, or academia. Students will be required to participate in the Pharmacoepidemiology Journal Club. Research topics must be related to pharmacoepidemiology and approved by the program coordinating committee. Required Courses (25 credits) Option-specific courses are italicized EPIB 639 Pharmacoepidemiologic Methods (4 Credits) EPIB 654 Pharmacoepidemiology 4 (2 Credits) EPIB 661 Pharmacoepidemiology 3 (2 Credits) EPIB 662 Pharma Basis of Pharmacoepidem (1 Credit) EPIB 701 PhD Comprehensive Examination EPIB 702 PhD Proposal EPIB 703 Principles of Study Design (2 Credits) EPIB 704 Doctoral Level Epidemiologic Methods 1 (4 Credits) EPIB 705 Doctoral Level Epidemiologic Methods 2 (4 Credits) EPIB 706 Doctoral Seminar in Epidemiology (3 Credits) EPIB 707 Research Design in the Health Sciences (3 Credits) Complementary Courses (3 credits) 3 credits of coursework in Biostatistics at the 500 level or higher. Courses must be chosen in consultation with the student’s supervisor and/or the degree program’s director or adviser. These courses can be chosen from the Department’s current offer of more than 40 courses in Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health as well as from other McGill Departments. Please contact the Global Health Option Advisor Robert Platt for any questions regarding this option. 3.3 Population Dynamics Option The Population Dynamics Option (PDO) is a cross-disciplinary, cross-faculty graduate program offered by the Centre on Population Dynamics (CPD) as an option within existing master’s and doctoral degree programs in the Departments of Sociology, Economics, and Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health (EBOH) at McGill. Students who have been admitted through their home department or faculty may apply for admission to the option. The option is coordinated by the CPD, in partnership with participating academic units. Thus, in addition to the rigorous training provided in the Department of EBOH, graduate students who choose this option become Centre on Population Dynamics (CPD) student trainees. This affiliation notably offers opportunities for interdisciplinary research and supervision. The option also provides a forum whereby graduate students bring their disciplinary perspectives together and enrich each other’s learning through structured courses, a weekly seminar series, and informal discussions and networking. With interdisciplinary research being increasingly important to understanding complex social and biological processes, CPD student trainees benefit from both a strong disciplinary foundation from their departmental affiliations, as well as from the sharing of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries through CPD activities.

The Comprehensive Exam is held once a year in June. 4.1 Purpose (needs revising and expanding) The exam is intended to test students’ ability to synthesize and integrate epidemiological knowledge. 4.2 Content and Structure (needs revising and expanding) For details on the Comprehensive Exam, see the course outline for EPIB 701 4.3 Evaluation (needs revising and expanding) The exam is graded “Pass” or “Fail.” Students with a “Fail” must repeat the exam the following year. 4.4 Reporting Results of the comprehensive exam will be transmitted to students within 3(2?) weeks of the date of the exam. "],["thesis-protocol.html", " 5 Thesis Protocol 5.1 Purpose 5.2 Format 5.3 Assessment", " 5 Thesis Protocol 5.1 Purpose All PhD students will prepare and defend a protocol for their thesis project. This is typically after students have passed the Comprehensive Exam after the first year of require coursework, though some students may elect to register for the course before passing their comprehensive examination, while defending their own protocol afterwards. It is intended to provide the student with the experience necessary to propose a comprehensive research project and to convince their peers of its scientific merit and originality. It provides a standardized critical evaluation to supplement the expertise of the student’s PhD supervisor and committee and thereby improve the likelihood of the thesis’ success. 5.2 Format The written protocol should emphasize the importance of the research objective(s) and the proposed methods for addressing them. As per McGill University policy, it can be written in English or French. It should provide sufficient background and detail on data sources; research design, statistical analyses, and power/precision/sample size (as applicable) for each of the research objectives; and study limitations. The student should make clear in the protocol text the extent of their original contribution to the proposed research, as well as the likely format (“traditional” vs manuscript-based) of the thesis. 5.3 Assessment [text likely needs revision] The thesis protocol is reviewed by two faculty members plus an external reviewer with substantive expertise in the student’s specific area of research. The student, thesis supervisor(s), and other thesis committee members are responsible for seeking the participation of the external reviewer. Importantly, the external reviewer must not be a member of the thesis committee, have previously supervised or co-authored a paper with the student, nor have been consulted about any aspect of the proposed research. "],["phd-thesis.html", " 6 PhD Thesis 6.1 Human Subjects Review", " 6 PhD Thesis Thesis research is normally actively undertaken following successfully passing the comprehensive Exam and defending the thesis protocol. It is expected that students will complete their degree within 48 to 60 months of entry into the PhD degree program. The thesis research begins with A thesis for the Doctoral degree must constitute original scholarship and must be a distinct contribution to knowledge. It must show familiarity with previous work in the field and must demonstrate ability to plan and carry out research, organize results, and defend the approach and conclusions in a scholarly manner. The research presented must meet current standards of the discipline; as well, the thesis must clearly demonstrate how the research advances knowledge in the field. Finally, the thesis must be written in compliance with norms for academic and scholarly expression and for publication in the public domain (see section: withholding a thesis from circulation temporarily). The nature of academic research requires adherence to McGill’s policies on research ethics and intellectual property, as described below. 6.1 Human Subjects Review Research involving human participants, animal subjects, micro-organisms, living cells, other biohazards, and/or radioactive materials must have had the appropriate compliance certification. Copies of any certificates of compliance must be retained by the supervisor and student in accordance with McGill’s policies on research ethics. Supervisors indicate on the Nomination of Examiners and Thesis Submission Form that the thesis research has complied with all ethical standards. See the Ethics and Compliance webpage for further information about certification and training requirements.

The transfer application material must be submitted by April 25 to gradadmin.eboh@mcgill.ca. 7.4 Policy on Departmental Seminars Updated November 9th, 2015 The Department considers attendance at its seminars an important component of training and expects all students to attend as frequently as possible. All Epidemiology and Public Health graduate students will be expected to attend 60% of the Epidemiology Seminars each term irrespective of their program year. Attendance at seminars will be mandatory to maintain “good standing” during academic studies. This means that attendance at seminars will be required to maintain eligibility for Departmental support for prizes, financial aid, travel awards, studentship applications, etc. Attendance at Biostatistics or at other seminars on campus or in teaching hospitals will be encouraged as always depending on one’s areas of interest but will not be mandatory. Students who will be unable to attend 60% of the seminars should send a request for an exemption to the chairs office justifying their absence (eg. residing outside of Montreal, travel relating to their studies, family reasons). 7.5 Policy on Email University Policy Concerning E-Mail As An Official Means Of Communication With Students. E-mail is an official means of communication between McGill University and its students. In order to satisfy the need for timely and efficient communication, and to provide a better service to its students, McGill University has instituted a policy that establishes e-mail as an official means of communicating with students. Upon registration at McGill, each student is assigned an official McGill e-mail address and a McGill e-mail box. This address may be viewed and verified via Minerva, under the Personal menu. The McGill E-mail Address points to the McGill e-mail box by default for all students. As with all official University communications, it is the student’s responsibility to ensure that time-critical e-mail is accessed, read, and acted upon in a timely fashion. If a student chooses to forward University e-mail to another e-mail mailbox, it is that student’s responsibility to ensure that the alternate account is viable. This policy applies to all McGill students and employees who manage official communications with students. For confidential and official communication requiring an original signature, communication is by (physical) mail. Therefore, please ensure that your current postal address is updated on Minerva. Students must also inform the Student Affairs Office and complete the details in Minerva. **Please keep in mind that although we do our best to keep all the information on the website up to date, we may have missed something. If you ever have questions about anything please contact the Student Affairs Office to clarify.
