Epidemiology is the study and analysis of the patterns and causes of disease in human populations. It forms the core discipline of public health by identifying the distribution and determinants of health and disease, and by gaining the etiologic understanding to intervene toward the improvement of population health. The PhD program in epidemiology at McGill trains scientists and health professionals to design and conduct studies, analyze health data and effectively communicate scientific results, and to gain novel insights into the causes and prevention of diseases at the population level. Epidemiologic work at the doctoral level involves a thorough integration of biological knowledge of pathogenesis, statistical knowledge of quantitative analysis and causal inference, and sociological knowledge to place these insights in the context of dynamic and interconnected human populations. Major areas of strength at McGill include epidemiologic methods, clinical epidemiology, infectious diseases, social epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology, public and population health, global health, environmental epidemiology, chronic diseases and aging, and perinatal epidemiology. 1.1 Competencies Our program aims to prepare our students for successful careers in epidemiology. Upon successful completion of the PhD in Epidemiology at McGill, we aim for our students to: Understand the difference between descriptive and etiologic epidemiologic studies, and the value of both designs for public health science; Develop a thorough understanding of modern epidemiologic methods and how they are utilized in the service of descriptive, predictive, and etiologic study designs; Apply quantitative skills to the analysis of epidemiologic data using statistical software; Systematically and critically review the epidemiologic literature, synthesize existing evidence, and identify important gaps in knowledge; Design, write, and critique an independent research proposal for answering epidemiologic questions; 1.2 High-Level Program Overview Successful completion of the PhD program in EBOH involves 4 key milestones: - Required coursework; - Passing a comprehensive exam; - Developing and defending a thesis protocol; and - Writing and defending the doctoral thesis. The timeline for program completion varies depending on each student’s circumstances and subject matter, but most of our students complete the PhD in around 5 years.

Students register for EPIB 702 in both Fall and Winter terms of their second year. 2.2 Elective courses Students are also required to take 9 credits of elective coursework, at the 500 level or higher, with a minimum of 3 credits in Biostatistics and 6 credits in an epidemiologic and/or substantive topic (normally related to the thesis topic). Elective courses must be chosen in consultation with the student’s supervisor and/or the degree program’s director or adviser. These courses can be chosen from the Department’s current offer of more than 40 courses in EBOH as well as from other McGill Departments. To assist you in your course selections see the Ph.D. Epidemiology Electives Guidelines page. Below in Table 2.1 you can find a list of current EBOH courses commonly taken as electives. However, courses from other departments or faculties may be possible, depending on the thesis subject matter and subject to the approval of your supervisor(s) and the Program Director.

They are NOT substitutes for existing courses but are, rather, ways for students in the programs to enrich their education in an organized way on topics not otherwise covered or not covered sufficiently (in depth or breadth) in existing courses. Students enrolled in the department may take Directed Reading courses for credit towards a degree under the rubric of the Special Topics offerings. These courses may be for 1, 2, or 3 credits. Directed Reading courses should conform to the usual semester format unless the specific circumstances of the course require flexibility. However, students are expected to complete such a course within no more than any six month period. Students will be expected to submit for approval in advance material that provides the objectives and methods to be used for the directed reading work. There is considerable flexibility in what constitutes a directed reading course, but certain requirements must be met before work can begin, including: Students must themselves propose a supervising faculty member with whom to work. With the faculty supervisor, students must prepare an adequate project proposal commensurate with the number of credits sought that includes: The rationale for doing this work as a Directed Reading course and for the number of credits sought. As well, this statement should indicate how it relates to, but is separate from, thesis work when the student is in a thesis program. An outline of the work to be done and the final product/output to be submitted. If a Reading Course is being proposed, a preliminary bibliography and a planned reading schedule should be included. A timetable, with appropriate milestones to assess a student’s progress and the measures to be used to evaluate the work (e.g., number of written assignments and their length). A student’s faculty supervisor will be responsible for this evaluation as is the case for “regular” courses. A timetable indicating when the student and faculty supervisor will meet. The project proposal, signed by both the student and the supervisor, should be submitted to the Student Affairs Office a minimum of one month prior to the start of the semester in which the course will take place. The director, along with one other person on the Program Committee who has accepted responsibility for curriculum matters, will review the proposal and determine if it is to be approved. Once approved internally, a copy will be sent to the Director of Graduate Studies as well as to the Department’s Graduate Studies Office, with a request that the latter obtain a Special Topics course number for the offering. A copy of the final approved version of the course content will be placed in the student’s file. 2.4 Example curriculum The timing and choices to fulfill the course requirements will likely be unique for each student. Below we provide one example of a possible curriculum over the course of the program.

These options all require additional courses to be completed in addition to the required courses for all Epidemiology PhD students. 3.4.1 Global Health Option This option will provide enhanced training in global health to graduate students registered in the Ph.D. in Epidemiology; Global Health degree program at McGill. Students will become familiar with topics of global health relevance and incorporate this into their core coursework and thesis research. The thesis must be relevant to global health and approved by the Global Health Coordinating Committee. Contextualizing the core training students receive in epidemiology and in their respective substantive discipline within the global health research domain will enhance their academic experience. Graduates of this option will be prepared to pursue further training in global health or to undertake a variety of career opportunities in global health in Canada or internationally. Program Requirements Thesis A thesis for the doctoral degree must constitute original scholarship and must be a distinct contribution to knowledge. It must show familiarity with previous work in the field and must demonstrate ability to plan and carry out research, organize results, and defend the approach and conclusions in a scholarly manner. The research presented must meet current standards of the discipline; as well, the thesis must clearly demonstrate how the research advances knowledge in the field. Finally, the thesis must be written in compliance with norms for academic and scholarly expression and for publication in the public domain.

Platt 3.4.3 Population Dynamics Additional Required Courses The Population Dynamics Option (PDO) is a cross-disciplinary, cross-faculty graduate program offered by the Centre on Population Dynamics (CPD) as an option within existing master’s and doctoral programs in the Departments of Sociology, Economics, and Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health (EBOH) at McGill University. Students who have been admitted through their home department or faculty may apply for admission to the option. The option is coordinated by the CPD, in partnership with participating academic units. Thus, in addition to the rigorous training provided in the Department of EBOH, graduate students who choose this option become Centre on Population Dynamics (CPD) student trainees. This affiliation notably offers opportunities for interdisciplinary research and supervision. The option also provides a forum whereby graduate students bring their disciplinary perspectives together and enrich each other’s learning through structured courses, a weekly seminar series, and informal discussions and networking. With interdisciplinary research being increasingly important to understanding complex social and biological processes, CPD student trainees benefit from both a strong disciplinary foundation from their departmental affiliations, as well as from the sharing of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries through CPD activities.

A student who has been accepted into the M.Sc. program can request transfer into the Ph.D. program. The formal transfer into the Ph.D. program should occur within 12 months of initial enrollment in the Master’s program. In order to transfer from the M.Sc. to the Ph.D. program, the M.Sc. student must complete all required courses for the M.Sc. program with a minimum GPA of 3.7. REQUIRED DOCUMENTS Biostatistics A three-page outline of the proposed Ph.D. thesis proposal; Letters of support from the current M.Sc. supervisor(s) and proposed Ph.D. supervisor(s). In cases where this is the same person, one additional letter from a faculty member in the Department is required. The letter from the proposed Ph.D. supervisor(s) must include a statement of financial support for the candidate and research. Epidemiology A three to five-page outline of the proposed Ph.D. thesis proposal including: Research question Background and brief literature review indicating the importance of the proposed research Preliminary research design Data source Preliminary analysis plan A timeline for completion of the Ph.D. program Letters of support from the current M.Sc. supervisor(s) and proposed Ph.D. supervisor(s). In cases where this is the same person, one additional letter from a faculty member in the Department is required. The letter from the proposed Ph.D. supervisor(s) must include a statement of financial support for the candidate and research. The transfer application material must be submitted by April 25 to gradadmin.eboh@mcgill.ca. 5.4 Policy on Departmental Seminars Updated November 9th, 2015 The Department considers attendance at its seminars an important component of training and expects all students to attend as frequently as possible. All Epidemiology and Public Health graduate students will be expected to attend 60% of the Epidemiology Seminars each term irrespective of their program year. Attendance at seminars will be mandatory to maintain “good standing” during academic studies. This means that attendance at seminars will be required to maintain eligibility for Departmental support for prizes, financial aid, travel awards, studentship applications, etc. Attendance at Biostatistics or at other seminars on campus or in teaching hospitals will be encouraged as always depending on one’s areas of interest but will not be mandatory. Students who will be unable to attend 60% of the seminars should send a request for an exemption to the chairs office justifying their absence (eg. residing outside of Montreal, travel relating to their studies, family reasons). 5.5 Policy on Email University Policy Concerning E-Mail As An Official Means Of Communication With Students. E-mail is an official means of communication between McGill University and its students. In order to satisfy the need for timely and efficient communication, and to provide a better service to its students, McGill University has instituted a policy that establishes e-mail as an official means of communicating with students. Upon registration at McGill, each student is assigned an official McGill e-mail address and a McGill e-mail box. This address may be viewed and verified via Minerva, under the Personal menu. The McGill E-mail Address points to the McGill e-mail box by default for all students. As with all official University communications, it is the student’s responsibility to ensure that time-critical e-mail is accessed, read, and acted upon in a timely fashion. If a student chooses to forward University e-mail to another e-mail mailbox, it is that student’s responsibility to ensure that the alternate account is viable. This policy applies to all McGill students and employees who manage official communications with students. For confidential and official communication requiring an original signature, communication is by (physical) mail. Therefore, please ensure that your current postal address is updated on Minerva. Students must also inform the Student Affairs Office and complete the details in Minerva. **Please keep in mind that although we do our best to keep all the information on the website up to date, we may have missed something. If you ever have questions about anything please contact the Student Affairs Office to clarify.

For international PhD students, the Department will use different mechanisms such as Deferential Fee Waivers, to cover the International Differential tuition so that they pay tuition at the same level as Canadian students. Financial support is conditional upon academic performance, as well as student efforts to apply for all external/internal graduate fellowship funding for which they are eligible, including CIHR, FRQS, SSHRC, NSERC, etc., as well as the McGill Faculty of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences and Hospital Research Institute competitions. 6.2 External Awards "]]
