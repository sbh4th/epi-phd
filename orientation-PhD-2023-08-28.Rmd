## Supervision
- Thesis students are expected to identify a supervisor by no later than 15 February of their first year of study.

- Contact the professors doing research that you find interesting (we can help).

## Requirements
- Must be an EBOH faculty member with supervisory privileges.

- Supervisor Nomination Form and Letter of Understanding due May 15, 2023

# Issues to discuss with your supervisor
.pull-left[
### More academic
- Course plan  by semester  
- Thesis timeline: dates for protocol; completion
- Authorship: expected papers; content, journals; conferences
- Thesis project: possible topics
- Members of supervisory committee
- Committee meetings: number and timing
]

.pull-right[
### Less academic
- Funding: personal, projects
- Ethics approval: timing
- Office hours: hours, open door
- Absences: sabbatical; holidays; conferences
- Work-life balance
- "Lab" rules and ways of working
]

# Funding
- EBOH 'guarantees' funding for 4 years, but note the package may be comprised of:
>Departmental stipend, research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and/or supervisory stipends. The combination may change from year to year. 

- Also subject to academic performance, participation in seminars, and a commitment to apply for award for which you are eligible. **Talk to your supervisor.**

- Some sources:
  - CIHR (October 17)
  - FRQS (October 5)
  - NSERC (October 17)
  - SSHRC (October 17)
  - McGill internal studentships (April 15)
  - TAships (required, once)
  - RAships (12 hrs/week *max*)

# Comprehensive Exam
.left-column[
```{r, echo=F, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
ggplot() + geom_fontawesome("fa-pencil", color='steelblue') + theme_void()
```
]

.right-column[
- Normally taken within 12 to 24 months after entry into the PhD degree program.

- The Comprehensive Exam is held once a year in June. 
- Two part exam:
  1. Epidemiologic and Biostatistical methods (based on 2 published papers)
  2. Study design

- Pass/Fail: Students must pass *both* with 65%. A "Fail" on either (or both) must repeat the exam the following year.
]

# Thesis Protocol
.left-column[
```{r, echo=F, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
ggplot() + geom_fontawesome("fa-rocket", color='steelblue') + theme_void()
```
]
.right-column[
- Propose and defend a comprehensive research project and to convince their peers of its scientific merit and originality.

- Provide sufficient background and detail on data sources; research design, statistical analyses, and power/precision/sample size (as applicable) for each of the research objectives; and study limitations.

- Reviewed by 2 faculty and an external reviewer.

- May require substantial revisions or resubmission.
]

# Doctoral Thesis
.left-column[
```{r, echo=F, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}

.right-column[
- "Officially" after passing the comprehensive exam and defending the thesis protocol. 

- Must constitute original scholarship and must be a distinct contribution to knowledge.

- Thesis committee should reflect the intellectual requirements needed to support your work.  
  - Minimum of 1 additional member (often a Biostatistician)
  - More usually better, especially for substantive, clinical, or methodological expertise and support.

# PhD Defense
.left-column[
```{r, echo=F, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
